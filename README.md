# Exploring eBay Car Sales Data
This project focuses on cleaning and analysing the real-life German dataset of used cars from *eBay Kleinanzeigen* (classified section of German eBay webpage). 
The goal is to clean the data and analyze car sales patterns to derive interesting and important data insights. 

## Project Structure
- `code.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook with Python code. 
- `autos.csv` - dataset of used cars from *eBay Kleinanzeigen*.

## Key Insights
- Standardized and transformed a 50,000-record German eBay car sales dataset using Python (pandas, NumPy) by parsing, cleaning, and validating heterogeneous fields (currencies, odometers, dates, German categorical values), eliminating anomalies and outliers.
- Analyzed and visualized brand-level pricing and mileage data to reveal market segmentation patterns across manufacturers (Audi, BMW, Mercedes vs. Opel, Ford, Renault).
